Update the entire UI and structure to a modern Course → Week → File hierarchy with responsive, high-quality styling.

Add a new 'Add Course' button for admins.

Clicking it opens a modern modal to enter the course name.

Save this as a new Course entry.

Create a new 'Courses' page for admins that shows all courses as floating, modern, card-styled tiles with shadows, rounded edges, readable font sizes, and spacious layout. Each course card must include:

Course name

Created date

A 'Manage Weeks' button

When the admin clicks 'Manage Weeks', open a page showing ONLY the weeks under that course.

Convert existing Week UI into floating cards with rounded corners, smooth hover animations, soft shadows, spacing, and clean typography.

Weeks must be draggable/reorderable with graceful animations.

Add Week button must match the modern style.

Teachers and trainers must also see the courses — but WEEK CARDS AND COURSE CARDS MUST BE READ-ONLY for them.

No edit icons, delete buttons, or drag handles.

UI should look identical but in a non-editable state.

UI & UX Upgrade Checklist:

All weeks, course cards, and file lists should FLOAT as modern cards.

Add soft drop shadow (material design style).

Use smooth animations: fade, slide, or scale on hover.

Typography must be readable: 15–17px body text, bolder headers, high contrast.

Improve spacing: generous padding and margin around elements.

Buttons should be rounded, pill-shaped, with hover glow.

Add responsive grid layout for courses and weeks.

Make sure UI adapts perfectly to mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop.

Responsiveness Requirements:

Use CSS grid / flexbox so Course cards and Week cards realign on smaller screens.

On mobile:

1 card per row

Large touch-friendly padding

No clipped text

Collapsible menus where needed

On tablet:

2 cards per row

On desktop:

3–4 cards per row

Viewer area must scale correctly inside smaller devices.

Database updates:

Add 'courses' table with id + name.

Each week must contain a 'courseId'.

All existing file logic stays the same, now under weekId → courseId.

Keep all viewer functionality (ppt, pdf, docx) working as before.

Teachers see viewer in read-only mode.

Admin sees editable controls.

Implement this entire redesign with modern UI components, floating cards, large readable fonts, and fully responsive layout that adjusts to every screen size.
