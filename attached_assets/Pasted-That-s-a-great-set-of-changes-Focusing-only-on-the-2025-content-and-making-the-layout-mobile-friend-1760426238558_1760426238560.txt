That's a great set of changes! Focusing only on the 2025 content and making the layout mobile-friendly (responsive design) is smart. Switching to a vertical format will also improve how it looks on smaller screens.

Here is the final, comprehensive prompt. It combines the login/roles, the training planner concept, the vertical layout, responsive design, and the removal of the 2024 Deck:

Hey Replit,

Let's finalize the web app for the Silver Leaf Training Program Planner.

1. Core Content Changes
Remove "2024 Deck": The planner should only include the 2025 Deck column.

Final Table Structure: The new table columns are: Weeks, Competency Focus, Objective, and 2025 Deck.

2. Design and Layout
Robust and Flexible Design (Responsive): The entire application (login page and planner) must use a responsive design so it looks robust and functions perfectly on any device (desktops, tablets, and phones).

Vertical/Card Layout: Change the display from a traditional horizontal table to a vertical format. Each "Week" should be displayed as a distinct, collapsible card or section.

For example, each card should clearly show the Week number and then list the content below it:

Weeks: Week 1

Competency Focus: [Text Here]

Objective: [Text Here]

2025 Deck: [File Link/Upload Button]

3. Login and User Roles
Create a clean Login Page.

Admin Role: Can log in and has full edit/manage access (Add New Week, Edit text fields, Upload/Replace files, Delete Week).

Teacher Role (View-Only): Can log in and view all the card content and download the files. They must not see any edit or management buttons.

4. Planner Functionality
A main "Add New Week" button should add a new card/section.

The text fields (Competency Focus and Objective) must be editable in place for Admins.

CRITICAL FIX: Ensure the edit field remains focused and active so the Admin can type without the cursor immediately moving away.

The 2025 Deck section needs a dedicated Upload button (for Admins) and displays the file as a clickable link.

Each Week card needs a clear Edit and Delete button (for Admins only).

Use a clean, modern aesthetic for the design. A simple backend for user auth, data, and file storage will be perfect.
