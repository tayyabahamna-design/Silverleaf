Replit Prompt — Add Teacher Interface, Batch/Quiz Workflow, and Trainer Renaming
Prompt:

This is an existing web application with core features already implemented.
Do NOT change or remove existing functions or interfaces except as specified below. Only add or update the areas clarifed.

Please implement the following enhancements:

1. Add "Teacher" User Type and Interface
Teachers should be able to register/sign up with name, email, and password.
On registration, the system generates a unique numeric Teacher ID (starting at 7100 and incrementing for new teachers).
Add a Teacher Login capability.
After login, add a new Teacher Dashboard where teachers can:
View all quizzes assigned to their batches.
Attempt quizzes (one attempt per quiz).
View quiz scores and a report card summarizing their performance, current level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced), and course progress.
2. Rename Existing "Teacher" Interface to "Trainer" (if not already)
Change all existing places where the "teacher" user type/interface currently refers to the (admin/quiz generator) role, to now use the label "Trainer" instead.
The "Trainer" dashboard and workflows remain unchanged but update all interface labels and internal variable names for clarity (do not break any existing logic).
3. Batch, Course, and Quiz Assignment (Trainer Side)
Allow Trainers to:
Create and manage Batches.
Add Teachers to a Batch by entering their unique Teacher IDs.
Select a Batch to view assigned Courses and Weeks.
For a selected Batch + Course + Week, generate quizzes (5–15 questions).
Assign a quiz to a Batch, making it available to those Teachers.
4. Quiz Completion and Reporting
When a Teacher completes a quiz:
Record their answers and compute their score automatically.
Update their progress for the relevant Course/Week.
Update a report card that places them into Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced based on defined criteria (by cumulative or average score).
Trainers can view progress, quiz scores, and report cards for all Teachers in a Batch.
Teachers can view their own report card, level, and progress.
5. Non-goals/Constraints
Do NOT modify, disrupt, or remove any existing unrelated functionalities.
Do NOT change the behavior of other user roles.
Only add new schemas, UI screens, or logic needed to support these enhanced workflows for Teachers and (renamed) Trainers.
Deliverables:

Only the code and UI for: new Teacher registration/login/dashboard, Trainer batch/quiz additions, Teacher ID generation, and reporting enhancements as per above.
Where applicable, provide only incremental code changes (backend models/fields, UI routes/components, forms, etc).
Brief notes or comments describing where new/modified code was inserted, so it can merge cleanly with the existing base.
Do not re-architect or refactor existing features beyond what is stated. Ensure compatibility with current user roles, data models, and interface flows.
