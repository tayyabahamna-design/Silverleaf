Conversation with Gemini

hi Gemini, so there is this organization named silver leaf, they have teacher training content in the form of Power point/google slides/canva slides (could be any type of slides format) i want to build a prototype through vibe coding with replit, to upload and store, edit, delete, view etc those power points, can you write a humane prompt for me? keep it simple okay, replit does the coding on its own, so i just need words to command him

Of course! Here is a simple and friendly prompt you can use.

Hey Replit,

I'd like to create a simple and clean web app prototype for an organization called "Silver Leaf." They need a central place to manage their teacher training presentations.

Here's what the app should do:

Upload: Have a clear "Upload Presentation" button so they can upload their slide files (like PowerPoint, etc.).

View: Display all the uploaded presentations in a simple list or as cards on the main page.

Manage: For each presentation in the list, please add buttons to Edit (to change the title) and Delete it.

Please use a simple, modern design that is easy to navigate. A basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript front end with a simple backend to handle the file storage would be perfect.

Thanks!








this is the content i will be uploading, like week, objective etc wise

Got it! Seeing the screenshot is super helpful. This isn't just a simple file list; it's a structured curriculum planner.

Let's update the prompt to be more specific. Here is a new version that describes exactly what you see in the picture:

Hey Replit,

Thanks for your help! I have a clearer idea now. I'd like to build a web app that works as a curriculum planner for "Silver Leaf," based on a design I have.

The main page should be a table with these columns: Weeks, Competency Focus, Objective, 2024 Deck, and 2025 Deck.

Here's the functionality I need:

Add a New Week: There should be a big "Add New Week" button at the top or bottom of the table.

Enter Information: When a new week is added, I should be able to click into the cells to type in the text for the 'Competency Focus' and 'Objective' sections.

Upload Files to a Specific Week: This is the most important part. Inside the "2024 Deck" and "2025 Deck" cells for each week, please put a small "Upload" button. This will let me add presentation files directly to the correct week and year.

Display Files: Once a file is uploaded, it should appear as a clickable link in that cell.

Manage: Each week's row should have an "Edit" button (to change the text) and a "Delete" button (to remove the entire row).

Please keep the design clean and easy to use. A simple front end with a backend to store the weekly data and files would be perfect.

Thanks!







there should be a dashboard too?



Show thinking
You're absolutely right! A dashboard is a great idea to give a high-level overview. It makes the whole app much more professional.

Let's combine everything into one clear prompt.

Hey Replit,

Let's build a web app for "Silver Leaf" to manage their teacher training curriculum. The app will have two main parts: a Dashboard and a Curriculum Planner.

1. The Dashboard (The Homepage)
This should be the first page users see. It should give a quick summary with a clean and simple design. Please include:

A Welcome Message: Something friendly like, "Welcome to the Silver Leaf Curriculum Hub."

Summary Cards: Three simple boxes showing key numbers:

Total Weeks Planned

Total Presentations in 2024 Deck

Total Presentations in 2025 Deck

Quick Action Buttons: Two clear buttons:

"Add a New Week"

"View Full Curriculum" (this will link to the Planner page below)

2. The Curriculum Planner Page
This is the main table for managing the content. It needs the following columns: Weeks, Competency Focus, Objective, 2024 Deck, and 2025 Deck.

Functionality:

The table should show all the weeks that have been added.

Inside the "2024 Deck" and "2025 Deck" cells for each week, there should be a small "Upload" button to add files.

Uploaded files should appear as clickable links in their cells.

Each week's row needs an "Edit" and "Delete" button.

The design should be simple and modern. A basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript front end with a simple backend to handle the data and file storage would be perfect.

Thanks for your help!







we are calling it cirriculum planner but it is for teacher training so the word will be correct? also the 2nd last prompt was good, i liked it better



Show thinking
You're right, that's an excellent point! "Curriculum" is often associated with students, so using a more precise term for teacher training is a smart idea. "Training Program Planner" or "Fellowship Planner" would be a much better fit.

And no problem at all! If you prefer the simpler prompt without the dashboard, let's stick with that. A focused, single-page app is a great way to start.

Here is the revised prompt, using the structure you liked with the better name:

Hey Replit,

Let's build a web app for "Silver Leaf" that works as a Training Program Planner. The goal is to organize their teacher training content in one simple place.

The main page should be a clean table with these columns: Weeks, Competency Focus, Objective, 2024 Deck, and 2025 Deck.

Here's the functionality I need:

Add a New Week: Include a clear "Add New Week" button that adds a new, empty row to the table.

Enter Information: I should be able to click into the cells for 'Competency Focus' and 'Objective' to type in the text.

Upload Files: Inside the "2024 Deck" and "2025 Deck" cells for each week, please add a small "Upload" button. This will let me attach presentation files directly to the correct week and year.

Display Files: After uploading, the file's name should appear as a clickable link in that cell.

Manage: Each row in the table should have an "Edit" button (to change the text) and a "Delete" button (to remove the entire row).

Please keep the design simple and modern. A basic front end with a simple backend to store the data and files would be perfect.

Thanks!







yr now i want to make it profile based log in like a few admin accounts which can edit upload etc and for the teachers etc they only view it, you see not everyone should have access to edit or delete




Show thinking
Excellent idea! Adding user roles is a crucial step for making this a real, secure application. That's a very common and important feature.

Let's update the prompt to include a login system with different permissions. We'll stick with the core planner design you liked.

Hey Replit,

Let's upgrade the "Silver Leaf Training Program Planner" to include user accounts and roles. The main goal is to allow Admins to manage the content, while Teachers can only view it.

Here’s a breakdown of the new features:

1. User Roles & Permissions
There should be two types of users:

Admin: This user has full control. They can log in, add new weeks, edit text, upload files, and delete weeks.

Teacher (View-Only): This user has read-only access. They can log in, view the entire training plan, and click/download the presentation files. They should not see any "Add", "Edit", "Upload", or "Delete" buttons.

2. Login Page
Please create a simple and clean login page that asks for an email and password.

3. The Training Program Planner Page
This page will now look different depending on who is logged in. The table structure remains the same: Weeks, Competency Focus, Objective, 2024 Deck, and 2025 Deck.

If an Admin is logged in: They should see the full version with all the action buttons we discussed before:

A main "Add New Week" button.

"Upload" buttons inside the Deck cells.

"Edit" and "Delete" buttons for each row.

If a Teacher is logged in: The page should be in a "read-only" mode. All the action buttons listed above should be hidden. They can see all the content and click the file links, but cannot make any changes.

Please use a simple front end with a backend that can handle user authentication, session management, data, and file storage.

Thanks!







whenever i click on the click to edit fields, it stays on for 2 seconds and the cursor moves to other field, not alowing me write


That's a frustrating bug! 🐛 It sounds like a JavaScript or focus issue where the input field isn't holding the cursor long enough for you to type.

Since you are using Vibe Coding with Replit, you can tell the AI coder exactly what is happening and what needs to be fixed. Here is a clear and simple command prompt to resolve this problem:

Hey Replit,

I'm running into a bug on the Training Program Planner page.

The Problem: When I click on the 'Competency Focus' or 'Objective' cells to edit the text (the "click to edit" fields), the cursor stays in the field for about 2 seconds, then immediately moves or loses focus, which prevents me from typing.

The Fix: Please check the JavaScript/frontend code handling the cell editing functionality. Make sure the input field remains active and focused until the user deliberately clicks outside the field or presses a key (like 'Enter') to save the changes. The cursor must not automatically leave the field before the user is finished editing.

Thanks for fixing this!








the bug is still there even after trying twice


That's frustrating! If the bug persists after trying the fix twice, it usually means the underlying cause is more complex than a simple focus loss, perhaps involving how the component re-renders or how data is handled.

Here is a more technical and specific prompt you can use. This time, we'll explicitly mention common causes for this type of issue, giving the Replit AI a better chance to debug the code.

Hey Replit,

The editing bug in the Training Program Planner is still happening. I click to edit the 'Competency Focus' or 'Objective' cells, the input field appears for a moment, and then it immediately disappears or loses focus, preventing me from typing.

It seems to be an issue with how the component is updating. Please investigate and fix one of these common causes:

Component Re-rendering: Check if the act of entering edit mode is causing the entire row or component to re-render, which would destroy the input field and replace it with the static text again. If so, ensure that the component state is managed properly to keep the input field mounted and focused.

Immediate onBlur Trigger: Check if an immediate, unexpected onBlur (loss of focus) event is being fired when the input field first appears, causing the field to close before I can interact with it. The onBlur event should only trigger when the user clicks outside the input field.

Parent Click Handlers: Ensure that no parent element (like the table row or cell) has a conflicting click handler that immediately overrides the input field's focus.

The goal is to ensure the input field stays open and focused until the user intentionally clicks away or presses a key like Enter to save.
