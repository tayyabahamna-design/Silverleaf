Design a responsive “Silver Leaf – Admin Analytics Dashboard” for an education/training platform with three roles: Admin (CEO), Trainer, Teacher.

Context:

Teachers are the ones taking courses (learners).
Trainers deliver trainings and manage course content.
Admin is the CEO-level user who oversees the whole organization.
This prompt is only for the Admin interface dashboard. The goal is to let the Admin understand overall health in under 30 seconds and then drill down.

Required sections on the page:

Global Summary (top strip)
Show 4–6 key KPIs: total teachers, total trainers, total active courses, total active batches, average completion rate, number of at‑risk batches.
Use large numbers, short labels, and clear visual status (color or small trend indicator).
Batches Overview
For each batch, display: batch name, number of teachers enrolled, number of trainers assigned, number of active courses, and a simple status (On track / At risk).
Allow expand/collapse for each batch and a “View batch details” action.
Courses Overview
For each course: course name, owning trainer(s), number of enrolled teachers, completion %, overdue assignments count, and course status.
Add an action like “Open course analytics”.
People Overview
Two subsections: Trainers and Teachers.
For Trainers: number of active trainers, per‑trainer list with assigned courses and latest activity.
For Teachers: number of active teachers, per‑teacher list with enrolled courses and risk flag (e.g., low progress).
Design and interaction requirements:

Use a clean, modern card-based layout similar to SaaS dashboards: light background, subtle shadows, consistent typography.
Minimize vertical scrolling; on desktop, use a two‑column layout where it makes sense.
Provide clear CTAs from each card so the Admin can jump to management views (e.g., “Manage trainers”, “View teacher profile”).
Handle empty states gracefully with helpful copy and a CTA (e.g., “No trainers yet – invite a trainer”).
Ensure the layout is responsive for laptop and tablet widths.
Output the complete HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript (if needed) in a single file, ready to run in Replit.
