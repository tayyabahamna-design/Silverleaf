Unified Replit Agent Task: Automated Quiz Generation & Caching System
Objective: Build a Python application that simulates an Ed-Tech platform's system for instantaneously serving quizzes to students by performing the slow quiz generation work on the Admin's side at the moment of content upload.

1. Initial Setup and Data
Technology: Use Python and its time library to simulate delays.

Quiz Cache (Database): Initialize a global Python dictionary named QUIZ_CACHE. This dictionary will store all generated quizzes and act as our instant database.

2. Admin Content Upload and Background Processing
Create a function named admin_upload_content(content_name, week_id) that simulates the slow, one-time task of processing content:

Simulate Delay: Immediately after the upload is confirmed, use time.sleep() for a significant duration (e.g., 5-8 seconds) to represent the time the AI/LLM takes to analyze the content and generate questions.

Generate and Cache Quizzes: After the delay, the function must simulate generating and saving TWO distinct quizzes into the QUIZ_CACHE dictionary:

Content-Specific Quiz: A quiz unique to the uploaded content (e.g., content_name).

Weekly Checkpoint Quiz: The function must also find the existing "Checkpoint Quiz" for that week_id in the cache and add the new questions to it.

Confirmation: Print a clear message showing that the caching is complete and the time it took.

3. Universal, Instant Quiz Retrieval (The Payoff)
The most important requirement is proving the instant availability of the cached quizzes across the entire application.

Create a generic retrieval function named retrieve_quiz_instantly(quiz_id) (where quiz_id is the content name or the week name, e.g., "Presentation1.pptx" or "Week 1 Checkpoint").

This function must instantly look up the quiz data in the QUIZ_CACHE dictionary and print it.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: This retrieval function MUST NOT contain any time.sleep() delay.

4. Final Demonstration
The program's final execution should run the simulation and clearly contrast the slow cost with the instant benefit:

Slow Step: Call admin_upload_content("Presentation-on-Classroom-Control.pdf", "Week 1").

Instant Step (App-Wide Access): Immediately after the slow upload finishes, call retrieve_quiz_instantly multiple times to show the instant access:

Once for the specific content quiz.

Once for the updated Week 1 Checkpoint quiz.

The output must clearly confirm that the slow process only runs once on the admin side, while retrieval is near-zero time for the student every time.
