Replit Prompt (Login + Create Account for Multiple Roles)
Prompt:

Please update only the login and account creation functionality of my existing web app (do not change or remove unrelated logic). Make the following changes:

1. Login Page
On the login screen, let users select their role: Admin, Teacher, or Trainer (using radio buttons, tabs, or dropdown).
Users enter their email and password, and select one of the three roles before logging in.
On successful login, the system routes each user to the correct dashboard/interface:
Admin: Opens the admin dashboard
Teacher: Opens the teacher dashboard
Trainer: Opens the trainer dashboard
2. Create Account Page
On the "Create Account" tab, show two large buttons or tabs:
Create Teacher Account
Create Trainer Account
When the user clicks one, display only the relevant form fields (username, password, email, first name, last name).
Teacher Account: The backend must automatically generate a unique Teacher ID starting from 7100 for each new teacher.
Trainer Account: Create a standard trainer profile (no special ID needed).
The selected form creates ONLY the selected account type, and does not affect any other roles.
3. UI Guidance
On login:
“Please select your role before logging in:”
On create account:
“Select account type to create:”
When a user clicks one of the create account buttons/tabs, show only the corresponding fields and submit button.
4. Requirements & Constraints
Do NOT change, remove, or affect any existing application flows, business logic, or database unrelated to login and registration.
All login/registration is with email, and each user only sees their role’s dashboard after login.
Admin login remains as-is.
5. Deliverable
Code for new/updated login and registration UI.
Backend logic for authenticating by role and creating unique teacher IDs.
Brief comments indicating where code was added or changed.
Note:
The existing app must remain intact except for these enhancements to login and account creation. No existing user or feature should be disrupted.
